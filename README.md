# Hello World Flask App

A simple Flask application that displays "Hello, World!" at the root URL (`/`). The project includes unit tests (pytest), behavior-driven development (BDD) tests (Behave), and a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Features
- Displays "Hello, World!" at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Handles invalid routes with a 404 error.
- Unit tests verify the main page and error handling.
- BDD tests ensure user requirements are met.
- Automated CI/CD pipeline runs tests on every push.
